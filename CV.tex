\href{https://www.renishaw.com/}{Renishaw} are a world leading engineering company with expertise in high-precision measurement and health care, and are listed on the FTSE 250 index -- I was part of their Group Engineering division.
\BulletItem
Researched, performed a feasibility and concept study, and built a prototype of a passive 3D scanner
\BulletItem
Designed, developed, simulated, and analysed a serial communication and PI control system in VHDL 
\BulletItem
Designed a high-level GUI application in \Csharp \ to interface with the system. Optimised performance by implementing a multi-threaded design, and integrated support for MATLAB and GNU Octave to run image processing script using \href{https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms221375(v=vs.85).aspx}{Automation}. Designed APIs to support EmguCV, Microsoft SQL Server, and an in-house developed graphics rendering library
\BulletItem
Completed preliminary schematic and PCB design for the next iteration of development
\BulletItem
Drafted comprehensive documentation covering design and implementation details including software documentation. Involved in code/design reviews and presentations with senior members of the team
\BulletItem
Trained new interns on Renishaw's in-house RTL/HDL design, simulation, and synthesis tools
\BulletItem
Completed several advanced training courses run by both internal and external industry professionals
%This research project involved doing a feasibility and concept study of a passive non-contact 3D scanner. It involved designing a serial communication \& PI control system in VHDL, simulation and formal verification of the design, and developing a high-level GUI application in \Csharp \ (Windows Forms) using the .NET Framework to interface with the system. Working on this project provided me with an in-depth understanding of the core functionality of the .NET Framework, COM, and RTL design flow. It particularly enhanced my knowledge of object-oriented design and multi-threaded GUI application development and significantly improved my programming skills in VHDL and \Csharp. This experience also helped me develop my core problem solving, interpersonal, and research skills.
