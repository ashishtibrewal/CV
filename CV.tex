This research project involved doing a feasibility and concept study of a passive non-contact 3D scanner. It involved designing a serial communication \& PI control system in VHDL, simulation and formal verification of the design, and developing a high-level GUI application in \Csharp \ (Windows Forms) using the .NET Framework to interface with the system. Working on this project provided me with an in-depth understanding of the core functionality of the .NET Framework and VHDL design flow. It particularly enhanced my knowledge on OOP design and multi-threaded GUI application development and also significantly improved my programming skills in VHDL and \Csharp.
